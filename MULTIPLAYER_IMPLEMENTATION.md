# Multiplayer Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the step-by-step phased execution plan to transform IMPHISE into a real-time collaborative whiteboard using the "Stateless Pipe" architecture.

---

## Phase 1: Database & UX Foundation
*Goal: Prepare the database and the UI to support opt-in collaboration.*

1. **Schema Migration:**
   - Execute an `ALTER TABLE drawings ADD COLUMN allow_public_edits BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;`.
   - Update the `Drawing` struct in `app/dashboard/page.go` to include this field.

2. **Backend Handlers:**
   - Add a new endpoint `PUT /api/draw/{id}/public-edit` that allows the owner to toggle `allow_public_edits` to `true` or `false`.
   - Update `api.SharedDataHandler` to return the `allow_public_edits` boolean alongside the scene data.

3. **Frontend UI (Dashboard/Canvas):**
   - Add a "Live Collaboration: [Off/On]" toggle button inside the Share modal.
   - Hook the toggle to send an HTMX `hx-put` request to the new endpoint.

## Phase 2: The Go WebSocket Hub (The Stateless Pipe)
*Goal: Build the bare-metal, zero-state routing engine in Go.*

1. **Hub Data Structures (`app/api/hub.go`):**
   - Create a `Room` struct containing a `map[*websocket.Conn]bool` and a `sync.Mutex`.
   - Create a global `Hub` struct containing a `map[string]*Room` (keyed by drawing ID / slug) and a `sync.RWMutex`.

2. **The WebSocket Upgrader (`app/api/ws.go`):**
   - Implement `GET /api/draw/{id}/ws` for authenticated owners.
   - Implement `GET /api/shared/{slug}/ws` for anonymous guests.
   - Both endpoints upgrade the HTTP connection via `gorilla/websocket` (or `x/net/websocket`).

3. **The Broadcast Loop:**
   - Write a `readLoop` goroutine for each connection.
   - When a byte slice (JSON payload) is received from a client, the server acquires the room's Mutex, iterates over the connections map, and executes `conn.WriteMessage()` to all clients *except* the sender.
   - Ensure `defer conn.Close()` and proper removal from the `Hub` when a connection drops.

---

## Phase 3: The Passive Client (Live Presentation)
*Goal: Enable read-only clients to passively receive updates in real-time.*

1. **WebSocket Initialization (`shared.templ` & `canvas.templ`):**
   - Inject the WebSocket connection script directly into the `.templ` files.
   - Example: `const ws = new WebSocket('wss://' + window.location.host + '/api/shared/{{.Slug}}/ws');`

2. **The EMP Tripwire (Thundering Herd Protection):**
   - Implement the `onclose` and `onerror` handlers with randomized exponential backoff.
   - `setTimeout(() => connect(), 1000 + Math.random() * 2000)` to ensure simultaneous reconnects (e.g., during an atomic deploy) are safely staggered.

3. **Applying Remote Patches:**
   - Implement `ws.onmessage` to parse the incoming JSON payload.
   - Call `api.updateScene({ elements: payload.elements })`.

---

## Phase 4: The Active Client (Live Collaboration)
*Goal: Safely broadcast local changes without causing infinite feedback loops or breaking the dirty-bit autosave.*

1. **Mounting the Editor:**
   - In `shared.templ`, if `allow_public_edits` is true, initialize Excalidraw with `viewModeEnabled: false`.

2. **The Infinite Loop Guard (Element Versioning):**
   - Track the highest `version` or `versionNonce` of elements received from the network.
   - In the Excalidraw `onChange` hook, deeply compare the local elements against the known network state. If the versions haven't incremented, abort the broadcast.

3. **Broadcasting & Dirty-Bit Overlap:**
   - If the `onChange` hook determines the change is genuinely local, execute `ws.send(JSON.stringify({ elements }))`.
   - Set `_dirty = true` to arm the local 3-second autosave interval.
   - **Crucial Verification:** Ensure that users receiving `onmessage` updates do *not* have their `_dirty` flags set, preventing them from hammering the SQLite database with redundant saves.

---

## Phase 5: Hardening & Load Testing
*Goal: Prove the architecture holds under pressure.*

1. **Thundering Herd Simulation:**
   - Connect 100 simulated clients to a single room via `k6`.
   - Bounce the Go server (`systemctl restart udin-canvas`).
   - Monitor Caddy and the Go runtime to ensure the randomized reconnect backoff prevents CPU spikes.

2. **Write Contention Verification:**
   - Simulate 10 users rapidly drawing in the same room.
   - Confirm that the overlapping 3-second dirty-bit autosaves queue perfectly in the SQLite `MaxOpenConns(1)` lock without producing `database is locked` errors.
   - Verify that data integrity is maintained (the last autosave wins).
